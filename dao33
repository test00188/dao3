What is Dao3?
Dao3 is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. It is free and open-sour
Dao3 is still in the very early stages of development. APIs can and will change (now is the time to make suggestions!). Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. Please don't build any serious projects in Bevy unless you are prepared to be broken by API changes constantly.
